### Perfection
The scene comes from 2011's X Men: First Class. Raven Darkhölme (Jennifer Lawrence), aka Mystique, a mutant with shapeshifting powers, attempts to seduce Erik by showing herself to him as a beautiful blonde woman (Rebecca Romijn).  
Erik responds by saying "I prefer the real Raven." Raven then shifts into the human form she usually presents to others. Erik presses, "I said the real Raven." Raven then turns into her natural blue form, to which Erik replies "Perfection."

### Unachievable quality



### Toward ISH
It’s natural to want to do well - at work, in study, in life, to do our best. 
But what happens when striving for the best becomes something more ... the pursuit of perfection? 
 
Perfectionism is on the rise and it has dire consequences for how we think and feel about ourselves and others, how we think, live, and work. Perfectionism has been seen to cause over-thinking, over-working, burnout, sleeplessness, and mental health problems like depression and anxiety. 
 
We can’t keep going like this!
 
But what’s the alternative if it’s not perfect?
 
Lynne Cazaly uncovers how to think, work and achieve in clever ways adapted from the productive and creative worlds of software development … and improvisation. 
 
How do they get things done? How do they put their ideas out there? And what can we learn from them? 
 
In ‘ish’, Lynne Cazaly explains:
- The problem with pursuing perfection … and why we seek it
- The mental loop that traps you into thinking perfection is the answer
- The role of incremental work, imperfection and iteration in getting things done
- The idea of ‘ish’ - which means somewhat, near enough - and how to apply it to your life 
- 9 ways to think and work on projects, tasks or activities that provide a healthy and productive alternative to perfectionism.
 
Excellence, quality and continuous improvement are important. But the pursuit of perfection … not so much. 
 
Here’s a helpful alternative that guides you to making great progress and achieving what you want in life.

> No intentaría ser tan perfecto, me relajaría más.
> Sería más tonto de lo que he sido,
> de hecho tomaría muy pocas cosas con seriedad.
