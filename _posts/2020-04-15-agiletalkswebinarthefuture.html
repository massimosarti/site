<p>This time it will be about Evolution of Work and Aspiration for the 2020s with Piotr Trojanowski
<br/>
The webinar provokes a human-centric view on the evolution of work and evolution of the purpose of work. It helps you out of the hamster wheel of the single loop learning and encourages a deeper reflection on the purpose of business.
<br/>
It summarizes the evolution of work in recent decades and the state of Agility at the end of 2010s. In parallel, the webinar equips you with a set of tools that will be useful to design your own vision of the future (Wardley maps, for 2020 double learning loop).
<br/>
This webinar is for all people-oriented leaders and practitioners, including CEOs, Agile Coaches, HR officers that sense friction between how their companies function and needs of employees and societies.
<br/>
For leaders who see limitations in how we work these days and look for inspiration for alternative ways of working: alternative ways of engaging people in their companyâ€™s mission, but also an alternative purpose of work in the first place.</p>
