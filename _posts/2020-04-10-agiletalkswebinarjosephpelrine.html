<p><b>WEBINAR IN INGLESE</b></p>
<p>What happens when the desire for psychological safety and team intelligence hits the reality of COVID-19, home office, and social distancing?<br/>
What happens when virtual boundaries endanger the social mores of decorum and politeness in human interaction?<br/>
What happens when the rules of communication and trust vanish behind bandwidth issues?
<br/>
And what can you do about this?
<br/>
Join us to hear a psychological perspective on how to build trust and psychological safety in a virtual working environment.
